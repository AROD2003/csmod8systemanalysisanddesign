# csmod8systemanalysisanddesign
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
The client was DriverPass. They wanted me to design an online course management system, as well as practice driving test and scheduling said tests. I think I outlined the requirements very well. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I could've added more possible limitations. I would be more specific on said limitations, such as me saying you need an internet connection. Perhaps I'd add more detail such as speed, and stability. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took what they needed and recommended the best things based on that. It's important to listen to the user's needs because they're paying for a product, and if you don't deliver the product they want, it could mean trouble. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I'm more of a "Get it working" proof of concept type of person. Meaning, I get a basic prototype proof-of-concept and then refactor and build off of that.
